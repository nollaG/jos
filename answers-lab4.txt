Challenge:
I implemented the sfork in lib/fork.c, this is quite like fork but
just map the page shared. And I defined thisenv in inc/lib.h as a 
function to return the correct pointer. Just see the code.


Question 1:
MPBOOTPHYS is the address where to place the boot_ap code, If it were
omitted the load address and the link address will not be the same one.

Question 2:
Because sometimes the kernel stack should save some values on the stack
before acquiring the kernel lock.
There are some instructions before acquiring the kernel lock but in kernel
mode.If every cpu sharing one stack,these instructions could be messy.


Question 3:
Because the pointer is above the KERN_BASE,and in kern_pgdir and env_pgdir,
there are both mapping in this area.
