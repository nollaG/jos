Question 1:
Using the current implementation can make trapno in trapframe,if we use
identical handler for each exception/interrupt we can not dispatch them
in trap handler.

Question 2:
Although a int 14 is called in softint.c,but we set the dpl for PGFLT to 0
so user program do not have enough privilege.If we let user program int 14
and trap to kernel,but we don't have errcode about it,and trapframe will be
wrong.

Question 3:
If you set the dpl of int3 to 0 and then the user program don't 
have enouth privilege to trigger int3 ,a int 13 will
caught.If you want to make it work properly,you should set the dpl of int3 to 
3 in order to allow user program trigger int3.

Question 4:
When the instruction want to trigger a interrupt/exception,the hardware
firstly will check whether cpl<=dpl or the int13 will be triggered instead.
